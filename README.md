# Water_body_Detection_from_Satellite_Images using Deep Learning Method
The image you sent shows the accuracy of various models for water body detection using deep learning from remote sensing. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the models and their accuracy:

Base Model: 69.38%
U-Net Model: 80.26%
Random Forest Classifier: 93%
Random Forest Classifier with Hyperparameter Tuning: 94%
ResNet50: 58%
As you can see, Random Forest with hyperparameter tuning achieves the highest accuracy (94%) for water body detection in this case. Hyperparameter tuning is a process of adjusting the settings of a machine learning model to achieve better performance. In this case, tuning the random forest model resulted in a significant improvement in accuracy over the base model.

Here are some additional points to consider:

U-Net models are a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture specifically designed for semantic segmentation. They have been shown to be effective in tasks such as medical image segmentation and satellite image analysis.
Random forests are ensemble learning methods that combine multiple decision trees to improve the overall accuracy of the model.
ResNet is a type of CNN architecture that has been shown to be very effective for image classification tasks. However, in this case, it appears to be less effective for water body detection than the other models.
Overall, the choice of model for water body detection will depend on the specific task and the available data. However, the results in the image you sent suggest that random forest models with hyperparameter tuning can achieve high accuracy for this task.
